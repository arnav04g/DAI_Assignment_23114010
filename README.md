# DAI_Assignment_23114010
This project contains Data preprocessing and Exploratory Data Analysis

The hotel_bookings.csv file contains the processed dataset . The original.csv file contains the original dataset 
The project.ipynb file contains the source code with executed cells

## Required Libraries
numpy , pandas , seaborn , matplotlib , math are several libraries which need to be installed 
# DATA Preprocessing 
I have used several functions for doing preprocessing .   
These include:  
Replacing the null values with median  
Removing the duplicate Rows with the help of drop_duplicates() function  
Removing the outliers by the help of winsortization function.  

# Exploratory Data Analysis    
UNIVARIATE ANALYSIS

The code further illustrates several ways of comparison of various columns (both categorical and numeric)  
The relationship between numeric columns are evaluated with the help of summary statistics , histogramd and boxplots.  
For categorical variables analysis , frequency plots are made.    

BIVARIATE ANALYSIS  

Correlation matrix and scatter plots are used to identify relationships between numeric columns .   
Bar plots , Violin plots and Boxplots are used to identify relationship between categorical and numeric columns   

MULTIVARIATE ANALYSIS

Pairplots , Heatmaps and Grouped comparisons are used
